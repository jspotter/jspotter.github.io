      <h5>Steel Drum Visualizer (2013)</h5>
      I am always looking for ways to use my technical skills in a music-related way. For my master's program in Computer Science at Stanford, I took a two-quarter sequence on symbolic music representation. During my second quarter in this sequence, I built a visualizer for my steel drum ensemble. The visualizer parses user-supplied MIDI files of four-part arrangements. It then plays these arrangements back, supplementing audio with a display that highlights the correct notes on each type of steel drum in time with the music. Check it out <a href='calypso'>here</a>!

      <h5>Course Evaluation Data Visualizer (2012)</h5>
      For our final project in a class on data visualization, my partner, Sophia Westwood,
      and I built a site that visualizes Stanford course evaluation data. Unfortunately, you
      need a Stanford ID to see it. However, you can
      <a target='_blank' href='final_paper.pdf'>see our paper here</a>.

      <h5>Pulses (2012)</h5>
      The little program on the front page of this site, called 'Pulses', was originally
      a project written in Java and
      <a target='_blank' href='http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu'>ChucK</a> for a Music, Science,
      and Technology class. The version
      made for this site was written entirely in JavaScript, though the sounds were still
      generated in ChucK. It uses <a target='_blank' href='http://jsgl.org'>JSGL</a>
      (JavaScript Graphics Library) and a
      <a target='_blank' href='http://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript'>k-d tree JavaScript library</a>.
      It relies on HTML 5 for the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag, which plays the sounds.

      <h5>Libev HTTP Client (2012)</h5>
      As part of my work at MoPub, Inc., I developed
      an HTTP client in C++ based on the
