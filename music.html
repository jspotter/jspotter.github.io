<h4>Paroxysm (2014)</h4>
This was originally written as a harpsichord piece. However, after it was written, I decided that it sounded better on a piano.

<h4>Drunken Waltz (2014)</h4>
I started writing this on a night bus in Vietnam. Part of the inspiration for the piece was the way the bus clumsily wrenched from side to side as it negotiated the unpaved road.

<h4>Mazurka for Three Guitars (2014)</h4>
This piece was the result of a weekly challenge my friends and I established while traveling in Southeast Asia. The challenge was to create something that related to three randomly generated nouns. Here are the three nouns that inspired this piece, along with a description of why each one is relevant:
<br><br>
<i>Polish</i> - The piece is a mazurka, a folk dance of Polish origin.
<br>
<i>Draw</i> - The piece can be thought of as a battle between major and minor which ends in a draw.
<br>
<i>Disease</i> - I tried to create the musical equivalent of a healthy organism that gradually becomes infiltrated by harmful foreign agents.

<h4>Don't Know Why (2011)</h4>
